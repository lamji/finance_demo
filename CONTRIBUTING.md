## 🤖 AI Code Assistance Guidelines

If you're using GitHub Copilot or any AI code generation tools, please follow these rules:

- ✅ Modify only the specific function, file, or section you're working on.
- ❌ Do not alter unrelated parts of the codebase.
- 🧠 Respect all existing comments, logic, and formatting outside your working scope.

This ensures minimal conflicts, better code reviews, and consistent logic.
